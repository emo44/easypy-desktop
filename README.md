**Design visually. Export native code. Build standalone executables.**

EasyPy Desktop is an **all-in-one visual development environment (IDE)** for **Python and PySide6 (Qt)**.  
Unlike other visual tools that trap you in a runtime "black box," EasyPy generates **100% native, structured, and readable Python code** that you can open, edit, and debug in VS Code or PyCharm.

## 🚀 What is EasyPy Desktop?

EasyPy Desktop is designed for developers who want the speed of a visual builder without sacrificing the control of code.

- **No Vendor Lock-in:** The output is pure Python (`.py`) files.
- **Visual to Code:** Drag-and-drop UI design that translates into clean `class`-based architecture.
- **Native UIs:** Built on top of the powerful PySide6 (Qt) framework.
- **Exe Compilation:** Package projects into **standalone Windows executables** in one click.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Experiment fast with plugins, widgets, and AI assistance.

The project is currently in **active development** and released as **public beta versions**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🐍 100% Native Code Generation (NEW)
EasyPy doesn't just "run" your project; it writes the code for you.
- Generates standard, indented Python methods (e.g., `def on_button_clicked(self):`).
- **VS Code / PyCharm Ready:** The generated code supports full syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and external debugging.
- **True Ownership:** You own the source code. If you stop using EasyPy, your project keeps working.

### 🎨 Pro WYSIWYG Editor
Advanced canvas with magnetic grid snapping, alignment guides, interactive resize handles, and a "Minimap" for easy navigation.

### 🤖 Context-Aware AI Assistant
Integrated AI system compatible with OpenAI-compatible APIs (including local LLMs). The assistant understands your project structure, widgets, and pages to generate logic for you.

### 🛠️ One-Click Compilation
Generate standalone Windows executables (`.exe`) using an embedded PyInstaller engine. It automatically handles asset bundling and dependency analysis.

### 🧩 Dynamic Plugin Engine
Highly extensible architecture. Add new tools and features by simply dropping Python scripts into the plugins system.

### 📦 Integrated Package Manager
Install and manage Python libraries (`pip`) directly from the IDE interface without touching the command line.

### 🐛 Live Test & Smart Debugging
Run your project instantly with `F5`.
- **Precise Error Reporting:** Runtime errors now point to the **exact line number** in your logic, making debugging effortless.
