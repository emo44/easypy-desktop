    "body": "**Focus:** Architecture Overhaul & Professional Logic\n\nThis release transforms EasyPy Desktop from a prototyping tool into a robust IDE capable of building complex, production-ready applications.\n\n### 🚀 Major Architecture Upgrades\n\n#### 1. 🌐 Global Code Editor\nA new tool that allows defining logic accessible across the entire project.\n*   **Global Scope:** Write code that executes *before* the main window loads.\n*   **Advanced Capabilities:** Import libraries (`import sqlite3`, `threading`), define Helper Classes (`class DatabaseManager`), or set Global Constants.\n*   **Persistence:** Create Singleton objects (e.g., a Shopping Cart or Game Hero) that persist state even when navigating between pages.\n\n#### 2. 🛡️ Static Menu Generation (Security & Debugging)\nThe compiler has been completely refactored to handle Menu Bar actions.\n*   **No more `exec()`:** Menu actions are now compiled into native Python methods within the generated class.\n*   **Professional Debugging:** Errors in menu scripts now report the exact line number in the traceback, making debugging trivial.\n*   **Enhanced Security:** Removes the risk of arbitrary code execution from dynamic strings.\n*   **Backward Compatibility:** Helper aliases like `ctx`, `find_widget`, and `goto_page` are automatically injected, so existing logic keeps working.\n\n### 🛠️ Other Improvements\n*   **New UI Icon:** Professional vector icon for the Global Code tool.\n*   **Updated Translations:** Full localization support for new features in English, Spanish, German, Russian, and Chinese."
