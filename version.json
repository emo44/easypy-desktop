    "body": "## 🚀 Major New Feature\n\n### 📊 [New] Project Flow & Auto-Documentation Suite\n**Transform your IDE into a self-auditing powerhouse.** Visualize logic, debug navigation, and generate professional documentation in seconds.\n\n*   **Visual Logic Flowchart:** Automatically generates a live diagram of your project structure. The engine intelligently parses `goto_page` commands, combobox navigations, and relative page links to map your application's flow in real-time.\n*   **Project Health Dashboard:**\n    *   **Orphan Detection:** Instantly highlights unreachable pages (broken links) that have no incoming connections.\n    *   **Plugin Dependency Audit:** Automatically lists all external and system plugins active in the project, ensuring you know exactly what extensions are required for portability.\n    *   **Complexity Score:** Monitors your project's \"Spaghetti Index\" to ensure maintainable logic.\n    *   **Assets Gallery:** A visual audit of all images and media files currently in use within the project.\n*   **Interactive Code Inspector:** A centralized table listing every widget containing custom logic. You can expand and read scripts directly in the report without opening the Action Editor.\n*   **HTML Export:** Save the full report (Diagram + Audit + Code + Assets) as a standalone **.html** file. Perfect for client deliverables, offline debugging, or project archiving.\n\n---\n\n### 🧪 How to Test\nTo explore these new capabilities immediately:\n1. Open the `Demo_test_suite.json` project.\n2. Click the new **View Flow Diagram** icon in the top toolbar."
