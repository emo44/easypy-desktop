    "body": "# EasyPy Desktop v1.7 - Beta 7 Release\n\n> **Significant Core Architecture Update**\n> This release marks a major milestone in the development of EasyPy Desktop, shifting from dynamic execution to native Python code generation.\n\n---\n\n## 🔓 Unlock Pro Features (Free for Beta Testers)\n\nTo test the **One-Click EXE Compilation** and all advanced features during this beta period:\n\n1. Download the file **`license_beta.epd`** attached to this release.\n2. Open EasyPy Desktop.\n3. Go to **Help > Activate Pro Version** and select the file.\n4. *Enjoy full functionality until May 2026!*\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Headline Features (Core Refactor)\n\n### 🛠️ [Refactor] Native Python Code Generation (No More Runtime Exec)\n**Status:** `Completed` | **Issue:** #76\n\nWe have completely rewritten the code generation engine (`generate_script`).\n* **Previously:** The application relied heavily on `exec()` and dynamic dictionaries.\n* **Now:** The builder generates **pure, native Python classes and methods**.\n    * Widgets are instantiated as explicit class members (e.g., `self.button_1`).\n    * Events are connected to real methods (e.g., `def _on_button_1_clicked(self):`).\n    * **Benefit:** The generated code is now readable, cleaner, faster, and friendlier to external IDEs.\n\n### 🐛 [Enhancement] Runtime Debugging & Console\n**Status:** `Completed` | **Issue:** #75\n\nWe have introduced a **Dedicated Console & Debugger Dock**:\n* **Real-time Output:** Captures `stdout` and `stderr` directly within the IDE.\n* **Error Reporting:** Catches exceptions and displays formatted tracebacks without crashing.\n* **Process Control:** A new \"Stop\" button allows you to kill infinite loops instantly.\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Workflow Improvements\n\n### 📜 New Feature: User Scripts Manager\n*Added a new \"Code Manager\" button (Red Icon </>) in the toolbar.*\n\n* Aggregates **all user-written code** from the entire project into a single list.\n* View, edit, and search scripts without clicking on individual widgets.\n\n### 🛡️ Enhancement: Automatic Backup System\n*Safety Net for Visual Development.*\n\n* Creates automatic backups (`.bak`) at configurable intervals (Default: 5 min).\n* Configurable via *File > Editor Preferences*.\n\n---\n\n## 💾 Installation & System Requirements\n\n**Note on Disk Usage:**\nEasyPyDesktop includes a **fully embedded standalone Python runtime**.\n\n- **Installer Size:** ~389 MB\n- **Required Disk Space:** ~1.48 GB (after installation)\n- **OS:** Windows 10 / 11 (x64)\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Time-Limited Beta Build\n\nThis is a **Beta Build** released for testing and evaluation purposes.\n\n- 📅 **Expiration Date:** **May 1, 2026**\n- After this date, this build will stop working.\n\n---\n\n## 👨‍💻 Note from the Developer\n\nEasyPyDesktop is developed by a solo developer. Please treat this beta as a technical showcase.\n\n⚠️ **Important:** This Beta 7 will likely be the last release until **March**, as I will be focusing on other projects in the meantime.\nIf you encounter any bugs, please report them via GitHub."
