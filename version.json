    "body": "**Focus:** Professional UI Layouts & Dynamic Panels\n\nThis release introduces two powerful widgets designed to create complex, professional-grade application interfaces (like IDEs or Dashboards).\n\n### ✨ New Features\n\n#### 1. ✂️ Splitter Widget (Resizable Panels)\nCreate dynamic layouts where the end-user can adjust the size of the content areas in real-time.\n*   **Dynamic Resizing:** Compiles into a native `QSplitter`, allowing the user to drag a handle between two zones.\n*   **Smart Drag & Drop:** The editor automatically detects empty slots. Drop the first widget to fill *Pane 1*, and the next one automatically fills *Pane 2*.\n*   **Customization:** Supports **Horizontal/Vertical** orientation and full styling (background colors, borders, shadows) via the properties panel.\n\n#### 2. ⚓ Dockable Panel (QDockWidget)\nBuild advanced applications with detachable tool windows and sidebars.\n*   **Float & Dock:** Panels can be anchored to the main window edges (Left, Right, Top, Bottom) or detached to float as separate windows.\n*   **Editor Visualization:** Represented in the canvas as a container with a **slim, non-intrusive header** (approx. 20px) and a transparent body for easy designing.\n*   **New Properties:**\n    *   **Dock Area:** Define the initial position (e.g., Right Sidebar).\n    *   **Dock Title:** Set the text for the floating window bar.\n*   **Scripting API:** New specific commands added to control behavior: `show()`, `close()`, `setFloating(True/False)`, and `toggleFloating()`."
